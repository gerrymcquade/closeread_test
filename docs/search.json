Look at the difference!\n\n\n\n\nwe can even zoom in to look at some of our communitiesâ€¦ for example around Addis Ababa:\n\n\n\n\nor even look at the difference across our communities by panning up towards Tigray!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nZooming\nPanning\n\n\n\n\nImage by Amber Kipp on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can split up sections of scrollytelling using normal text, figures, tables and graphs:\nAenean placerat luctus tortor vitae molestie. Nulla at aliquet nulla. Sed efficitur tellus orci, sed fringilla lectus laoreet eget. Vivamus maximus quam sit amet arcu dignissim, sed accumsan massa ullamcorper. Sed iaculis tincidunt feugiat. Nulla in est at nunc ultricies dictum ut vitae nunc. Aenean convallis vel diam at malesuada. Suspendisse arcu libero, vehicula tempus ultrices a, placerat sit amet tortor. Sed dictum id nulla commodo mattis. Aliquam mollis, nunc eu tristique faucibus, purus lacus tincidunt nulla, ac pretium lorem nunc ut enim. Curabitur eget mattis nisl, vitae sodales augue. Nam felis massa, bibendum sit amet nulla vel, vulputate rutrum lacus. Aenean convallis odio pharetra nulla mattis consequat.\n\n\nJuxtaposing images\nI have even tried out using a bit of Javascript to give a juxtapose of 2 images, which lets you use the slider to compare across time, give it a try below!\n\n\n\n\nHopefully it works! Testing it a bit however it seems the juxtapose.js doesnâ€™t work inside the scrollytelling sectionsâ€¦ðŸ˜­\n\n\n\n\nThe text can be moved around, we can set it to layout on the right side of the sticky item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can have it overlay the image/item, aligned to the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr over the top of the itemâ€¦\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExectuable code\nSo far I have used images that are pre-rendered, but as I am typing this using Quarto markdown in R, I can display the output of code executed in R (and python, Julia, Observable, etc)\n\n\n\n\nHere is a simple graph made using this code:\n\nhist(rnorm(15))\n\n\n\n\n\nthey can even be interactive!"
