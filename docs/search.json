Look at the difference!\n\n\n\n\nwe can even zoom in to look at some of our communitiesâ€¦ for example around Addis Ababa:\n\n\n\n\nor even look at the difference across our communities by panning up towards Tigray!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nZooming\nPanning\n\n\n\n\nImage by Amber Kipp on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can split up sections of scrollytelling using normal text, figures, tables and graphs:\nDuis urna urna, pellentesque eu urna ut, malesuada bibendum dolor. Suspendisse potenti. Vivamus ornare, arcu quis molestie ultrices, magna est accumsan augue, auctor vulputate erat quam quis neque. Nullam scelerisque odio vel ultricies facilisis. Ut porta arcu non magna sagittis lacinia. Cras ornare vulputate lectus a tristique. Pellentesque ac arcu congue, rhoncus mi id, dignissim ligula.\n\n\nJuxtaposing images\nI have even tried out using a bit of Javascript to give a juxtapose of 2 images, which lets you use the slider to compare across time, give it a try below!\n\n\n\n\nHopefully it works! Testing it a bit however it seems the juxtapose.js doesnâ€™t work inside the scrollytelling sectionsâ€¦ðŸ˜­\n\n\n\n\nThe text can be moved around, we can set it to layout on the right side of the sticky item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can have it overlay the image/item, aligned to the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr over the top of the itemâ€¦\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I have used images that are pre-rendered, but as I am typing this using Quarto markdown in R, I can display the output of code executed in R (and python, Julia, Observable, etc)\n\n\n\n\nHere is a simple graph made using this code:\n\nhist(rnorm(15))\n\n\n\n\n\nthey can even be interactive!"
